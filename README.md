#### Running the Program
In order to run the httpserver.cpp file, you run:
```sh
$ ./httpserver -A [ip address] -P [port] -l [log file] -c
```
NOTE: This program must be run with -A for address, -P for port, -l for log file, and -c in order to work with cache. -P Port and -l log file name  and -c do not have to be provided (The default would be 80 for the port number).
